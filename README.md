# Climate-Policy-AI
This project uses gen AI and machine learning to generate and evaluate climate policy solutions. It utilizes a trained BiLSTM model to predict policy effectiveness and GPT-4o to create new policy ideas. The system tests these policies to identify the most likely to be impactful solutions for climate issues.
